		<h1>My Kitchen's Shitty, But My Life Is Funny.</h1>	
		<p>Nothing makes me happier than cooking for people that I love.</p>

		<h2>This is a blog all about the ways I go about avoiding cooking in my forsaken kitchen. I created a career path as a freelance private chef, where I cook in incredibly nice homes with fancy appliances, cabinets that open all the way, ovens that fit normal sheet pans, and stoves that produce more than smoke and cO2. This blog showcases my dining adventures, from places that smell like rat poison and dehydrated squid, to Michelin stars and heavy table linens. Anything to avoid actually feeding myself like an adult, because cooking for myself is torture but I love to cook.</h2>
