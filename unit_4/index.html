			<h2>I've created a really quirky niche as a private chef for some amazing people.</h2>
			<p>I cook in incredibly nice homes with fancy appliances, cabinets that open all the way, ovens that fit normal sheet pans, and stoves that produce more than just smoke and CO2.</p>p
			<p> Now i'm just looking for a safe space to tell my stories.</p>
			<h3>Weird things happen when I leave the house...</h3> 
			<p>I'll do just about anything to avoid actually feeding myself like an adult.  Cooking for myself is torture but I love to cook for others, and eating is lifes greatest pleasure.</p>
